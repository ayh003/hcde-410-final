Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between hearing difficulties and access to hearing aids across different age groups, focusing on identifying barriers to access. The goal is to analyze data on hearing loss, hearing aid usage rates to uncover barriers that may impact access to hearing aids and to overall improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

Motivation
Hearing loss affects millions of people worldwide, and while it is often associated with aging, it can impact individuals of all ages. Despite the significant benefits of hearing aids, access to these devices remains limited for many, especially in certain demographic groups. This project aims to better understand the barriers preventing individuals from obtaining hearing aids and learn more about issues surrounding various age groups.
