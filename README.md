# Hearing Aid Accessibility Research

**Project Overview**
This project investigates the accessibility of hearing aids across different age groups, with a focus on understanding how different factors influence the accessibility of hearing aids. The analysis is based on a dataset that includes demographic and economic information related to untreated hearing loss in individuals. My overall goal of this project is to examine hearing difficulties and access to hearing aids across different age groups, with a specific focus on identifying barriers and inequalities that hinder accessibility.

**Research Questions**
1. How accessible are hearing aids across different age groups?
2. In what ways do different types of hearing aids address the specific needs of users?

**Key Findings**
1. Economic Barriers
2. Hearing Aid Types:

**Technologies Used**
Python (for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for creating visualizations)
ChatGPT (assisted with grammar and code )
